# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 2nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Resumed Working on the Simple Banking System (learned about ALTER TABLES and Consistency Constraints on SQL), committed to the challenge, and setup the github project

**Thoughts:** It will probably take me by the end of this week to get back into the flow of things with my project. Need to do this for 21 days straight to make it into a habit. I hope I am able to do it. 

**Link to work:** Not Available at this point as this was purely lessons on JetBrains Academy.
